Billboard frontend
==================

Simple static UI that talks to the backend.

Quick start
-----------
1. Start backend (see `../backend/README.md`).
2. Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser (or serve it with any static server).

Notes
-----
- By default the frontend assumes backend is at `http://localhost:8080`. To change, set `window.API_BASE` from a small wrapper or serve a tiny page that sets it.
